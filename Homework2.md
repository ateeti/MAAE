## Chapter 4 : Multiple Regression Analysis

<strong>C6</strong> Use the data in WAGE2 for this exercise.

i. Consider the standard wage equation $\ log(wage) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + \beta_2 exper + \beta_3 tenure + u$
* $H_0 : \beta_2 = \beta_3$
* $H_1 : \beta_2 \neq \beta_3$

ii. Test the null hypothesis in part (i) against a two-sided alternative, at the 5% significance level, by constructing a 95% confidence interval. What do you conclude?

<strong>C8</strong> The data set 401KSUBS contains information on net financial wealth (nettfa),age of the survey respondent (age), annual family income (inc), family size(fsize), and participation in certain pension plans for people in the UnitedStates. The wealth and income variables are both recorded in thousands ofdollars. For this question, use only the data for single-person households (so $fsize = 1$)

i. How many single-person households are there in the data set?

-

ii. Use OLS to estimate the model

$nettfa = \beta_0 + \beta_1inc + \beta_2age + u$

Interpret the slope coefficients. Are there any surprises in the slope estimates?

-

iii. Does the intercept from the regression in part (ii) have an interesting meaning? Explain.

-

iv. Find the p-value for the test $H_0 : \beta_2 = 1$ against $H_1 : \beta_2 < 1$. Do you reject at the 1% significance level?
